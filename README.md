# rioweb

## what is?

`rioweb` is a bare-bone simple, web-based, interface to the
[rio](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rio) R package.

## What does?

It aims to expose the bunch of routines for data input/output available in
the R community, in order to allow the user to convert between various file
formats, by a simple upload (original) / download (converted) interface.

Therefore can be seen as a simple, web-based, free equivalent to programs
such as [StatTransfer](http://www.stattransfer.com/) or
[SledgeHammer](http://www.openmetadata.org/site/?page_id=1089).

## Where is?

The app lives at http://lbraglia.shinyapps.io/rioweb; the development
repository is [here](http://github.com/lbraglia/rioweb).

## Disclaimers

`rioweb` is deployed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any
warranty to the extent permitted by applicable law.

`rioweb` is still in its infancy.
