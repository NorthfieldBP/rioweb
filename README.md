# rioweb

## what is?

`rioweb` is a bare-bone simple, web-based, interface to the
[rio](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rio) R package.

## what does?

It exposes the bunch of routines for file formats conversion available in
the R community, by a simple upload (original) / download (converted)
interface.

Therefore can be seen as a simple, web-based, free equivalent to programs
such as [StatTransfer](http://www.stattransfer.com/) or
[SledgeHammer](http://www.openmetadata.org/site/?page_id=1089).

The app lives at http://lbraglia.shinyapps.io/rioweb; the development
repository is [here](http://github.com/lbraglia/rioweb).
